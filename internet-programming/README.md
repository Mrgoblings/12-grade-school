# Internet Programming Class

This repository contains all the homework assignments for the Internet Programming class.

Each assignment is located in its own folder with a `README.md` file containing documentation on how to run and test the code. For example, you can find the first homework assignment in the [hw1](./hw1/) folder and so on.

All future homework assignments will follow the same structure.
